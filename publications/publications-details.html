										<b>Abstract:</b> <br>
										Lack of dopamine (DA) in the striatum and the consequential dysregulation of thalamocortical circuits are major causes of motor impairments in Parkinson's disease. 
										The striatum receives multiple cortical and subcortical afferents. Its role in movement control and motor skills learning is regulated by DA from the nigrostriatal pathway. 
										In Parkinson's disease, DA loss affects striatal network activity and induces a functional imbalance of its output pathways, impairing thalamocortical function. 
										Striatal projection neurons are GABAergic and form two functionally antagonistic pathways: the direct pathway, originating from DA receptor type 1-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1 R-MSN), 
										and the indirect pathway, from D2 R-MSN. Here, we investigated whether DA depletion in mouse striatum also affects GABAergic function. 
										We recorded GABAergic miniature IPSCs (mIPSC) and tonic inhibition from D1 R- and D2 R-MSN and used immunohistochemical labeling to study GABAA R function and subcellular distribution in 
										DA-depleted and control mice. We observed slower decay kinetics and increased tonic inhibition in D1 R-MSN, while D2 R-MSN had increased mIPSC frequency after DA depletion. 
										Perisomatic synapses containing the GABAA R subunits α1 or α2 were not affected, but there was a strong decrease in non-synaptic GABAA Rs containing these subunits, suggesting altered receptor trafficking. 
										To broaden these findings, we also investigated GABAA Rs in GABAergic and cholinergic interneurons and found cell type-specific alterations in receptor distribution, likely reflecting changes in connectivity. 
										Our results reveal that chronic DA depletion alters striatal GABAergic transmission, thereby affecting cellular and circuit activity. 
										These alterations either result from pathological changes or represent a compensatory mechanism to counteract imbalance of output pathways.<br>

											<b>Abstract:</b> <br>
											The striatum is the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia, mediating motor and cognitive functions. Striatal projection neurons are GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSN), 
											expressing either the dopamine receptor type 1 (D1 -R MSN) and forming the direct, movement-promoting pathway, or dopamine receptor type 2 (D2 -R MSN), 
											forming the indirect movement-suppressing pathway. Locally, activity and synchronization of MSN are modulated by several subtypes of GABAergic and cholinergic interneurons. 
											Overall, GABAergic circuits in the striatum remain poorly characterized, and little is known about the intrastriatal connectivity of interneurons and the distribution of GABAA receptor 
											(GABAA R) subtypes, distinguished by their subunit composition, in striatal synapses. Here, by using immunofluorescence in mouse tissue, we investigated the distribution of 
											GABAA Rs containing the α1 , α2 , or α3 subunit in perisomatic synapses of striatal MSN and interneurons, as well as the innervation pattern of D1 R- and D2 R-MSN soma and axonal 
											initial segment (AIS) by GABAergic and cholinergic interneurons. Our results show that perisomatic GABAergic synapses of D1 R- and D2 R-MSN contain the GABAA R α1 and/or α2 subunits, 
											but not the α3 subunit; D2 R-MSN have significantly more α1 -GABAA Rs on their soma than D1 R-MSN. Further, interneurons have few perisomatic synapses containing α2 -GABAA Rs, 
											whereas α3 -GABAA Rs (along with the α1 -GABAA Rs) are abundant in perisomatic synapses of CCK+ , NPY+ /SOM+ , and vAChT+ interneurons. Each MSN and interneuron population analyzed 
											received a distinct pattern of GABAergic and cholinergic innervation, complementing this postsynaptic heterogeneity. In conclusion, intra-striatal GABAergic circuits are distinguished 
											by cell-type specific innervation patterns, differential expression and postsynaptic targeting of GABAA R subtypes.<br>

											<b>Abstract:</b> <br>
											As the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia, the striatum plays a central role in planning, control, and execution of movement and motor skill learning. 
											More than 90% of striatal neurons, so-called medium spiny neurons (MSN), are GABAergic projection neurons, innervating primarily the substantia nigra pars reticulata or the globus pallidus internus. 
											The remaining neurons are GABAergic and cholinergic interneurons, synchronizing and controlling striatal output by reciprocal connections with MSN. Besides prominent local cholinergic influence, 
											striatal function is globally regulated by dopamine (DA) from the nigrostriatal pathway. Little is known about whether DA depletion, as occurs in Parkinson's disease, 
											affects the activity of striatal interneurons. Here we focused on neuropeptide Y (NPY)-expressing interneurons, which are among the major subgroups of GABAergic interneurons in the striatum. 
											We investigated the effects of striatal DA depletion on GABAergic transmission in NPY interneurons by electrophysiologically recording GABAergic spontaneous (s) and miniature (m) 
											inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in identified NPY interneurons in slices from 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)- and vehicle-injected transgenic NPY-humanized 
											Renilla green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) mice with the whole cell patch-clamp technique. We report a significant increase in sIPSC and mIPSC frequency as well as the occurrence of 
											giant synaptic and burst sIPSCs in the 6-OHDA group, suggesting changes in GABAergic circuit activity and synaptic transmission. IPSC kinetics remained unchanged, pointing to mainly 
											presynaptic changes in GABAergic transmission. These results show that chronic DA depletion following 6-OHDA injection causes activity-dependent and -independent increase of synaptic 
											GABAergic inhibition onto striatal NPY interneurons, confirming their involvement in the functional impairments of the DA-depleted striatum.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neuropeptide Y (NPY) interneurons 
											regulate the function of striatal projection neurons and are upregulated upon dopamine depletion in the striatum. Here we investigated how dopamine depletion affects NPY circuits and show 
											electrophysiologically that it leads to the occurrence of giant synaptic and burst GABAergic spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and to an activity-independent increase in 
											GABAergic miniature IPSC frequency in NPY neurons. We suggest that degeneration of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum causes functional changes in striatal GABAergic function.<br>
